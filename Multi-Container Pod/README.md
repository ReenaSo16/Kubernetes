create a Pod with two containers that communicate with each other, we can use a shared localhost (127.0.0.1) and a shared volume for inter-container communication.

Container 1: Runs an NGINX web server on port 80.
Container 2: Runs a BusyBox container that continuously fetches the webpage from the first container.


Both containers share the same network namespace inside the Pod.
The BusyBox container accesses the Nginx container using 127.0.0.1.
